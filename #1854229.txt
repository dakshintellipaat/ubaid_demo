As you requested for the commands so here we are,

Problem: Problem with your commands is you have pushed to develop branch and again you are pushing the same branch.

Solution --> To deal with it firstly you have to pull the current changes in remote branch to your local branch so that both repository and your local system are on same position,

now for that you have to do:

git pull develop

now, you have to push the develop again after making(committing) some changes:
make sure you do not have any uncommitted changes in your current branch otherwise it will give u conflict.
